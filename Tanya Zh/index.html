        Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes. <br> The show follows Holmes, a recovering drug addict and former consultant to Scotland Yard, as he assists the New York
        City Police Department in solving crimes. His indifference to police procedure often leads to conflict with Captain
        Thomas Gregson (Aidan Quinn), although the two still remain respectful of one another. Holmes is accompanied by Dr. Joan
        Watson (Lucy Liu), who initially acts as his sober companion. She is a former surgeon and was hired by Sherlock's father
        to help him in his rehabilitation. They eventually begin to work together on his cases; in time she becomes Holmes'
        apprentice and later his professional partner. The series also features Holmes' ongoing conflict with his nemesis Jamie
        Moriarty (Natalie Dormer).</p>
